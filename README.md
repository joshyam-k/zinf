# Zero-Inflation Models: `zinf`

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of zinf is to define methods for both Frequentist and Bayesian
Zero-Inflation Models with random effects that allows the user to
interact with them in the same way that they do with typical R modeling
functions.

## Installation

You can install the development version of zinf from
[GitHub](https://github.com/joshyam-k/zinf) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("joshyam-k/zinf")
```

## Main Components

`zinf` constists of two main functions

- `zinf_freq`
- `zinf_bayes`

## Example
